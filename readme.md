### CDN Pull

Run encoder with media dir at `/data`

```
% ORIGIN_DIR=/data npm start
```

### User Interface

Web user interface available at `http://localhost:8000/`

### API

Start encoder:

```
% curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/encoder' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "timeout": 0
}'
```

Get status:

```
% curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/encoder' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

If status is `starting` you can start pushing to the RTMP address `rtmp://<your-host-ip>:1935/live/stream` (where `stream` is the streamkey).

When status is `running` you can play the HLS from `http://localhost:8000/origin/hls/index.m3u8`

Top stop the encoder:

```
% curl -X 'DELETE' \
  'http://localhost:8000/api/encoder' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

### CDN Push (AWS Media Package)

Run encoder with media dir at `/data`

```
% ORIGIN_DIR=/data \
  OUTPUT_URL=https://<username>>:<password>@xxxxx.mediapackage.xxxx.amazonaws.com/in/v2/e82a0fc53d4b44ec89ac1a1fccd3a333/e82a0fc53d4b44ec89ac1a1fccd3a333/channel \
  npm start
```

### Docker

Run Eyevinn live encoding as a Docker container where `/tmp/media` is a directory on your host.

```
% docker run --rm -d \
  -p 8000:8000 -p 1935:1935 \
  -v /tmp/media:/data \
  eyevinntechnology/live-encoding
```

## Development

Start the API in development mode that restart server if file changes.

```
% DEBUG=1 npm run dev
```

API is then available at http://localhost:8000/api

Start the web application in development mode

```
% npm run dev:app
```

Then the web application is available at http://localhost:3000/ and will connect to the API on port 8000.

To then build the app run:

```
% npm run build:app
```

The output is placed in the folder `out/` that is then served by the server.
